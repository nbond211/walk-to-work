## Summary
From 1.31.17 until 6.28.17, I walked to work every morning in Brooklyn, NY and took a photo at a different location during my commute. I extracted prominent colors, date time information, and gps coordinates from each photo. Walk To Work is a data visualization built with React to explore the colors seen during my commute over time.
